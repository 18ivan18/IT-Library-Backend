# IT-Library-Backend

Backend written in javascript for the IT-Library project.

# How to?

First run `npm i` to install the node modules. Then you'll need a `.env` file in your project main directory. It will consists the following env variables needed to run the project.

> PORT_SERVER=
> <br>
> DB_NAME=
> <br>
> DB_PASS=
> <br>
> DB_DIALECT=mssql
> <br>
> DB_DATABASE=
> <br>
> DB_USER=
> <br>
> ACESS_TOKEN_SECRET=

They are pretty self explanatory so I won't go into detail for now.

Run the server with the `npm start` command from your terminal while in the main directory.
